- Thonny IDE or similar development environment

## üîß Installation & Setup

### 1. Hardware Assembly

1. **LCD Display**:
   - Connect VCC to 3.3V, GND to GND
   - SDA to GP0, SCL to GP1

2. **Security Sensors**:
   - Door MC-38: GP2 with pull-up resistor
   - Window MC-38: GP3 with pull-up resistor  
   - PIR MH-SR602: GP4 (VCC=3.3V, GND=GND)

3. **User Interface**:
   - Keypad rows: GP6, GP7, GP8, GP9
   - Keypad columns: GP10, GP11, GP12 (with pull-down)
   - Arm button: GP13 with pull-up resistor
   - Buzzer: GP5 (PWM)

### 2. Software Configuration

1. **Upload Required Files**:
   - `main.py` (main security system)
   - `pico_i2c_lcd.py` (LCD library)

2. **Configure WiFi**:
   ```python
   WIFI_SSID = "your_wifi_SSID"
   WIFI_PASSWORD = "your_wifi_password"
   ```

3. **Set Timezone**:
   ```python
   TIMEZONE_OFFSET =   # Adjust for your timezone
   ```

### 3. Initial Startup

1. Power on the system
2. Watch for WiFi connection status on LCD
3. System will sync time via NTP
4. Web server starts automatically
5. Test sensors during initialization

## üéÆ System Operation

### Arming the System

1. **Pre-arm Check**: Ensure all entry points are closed and no motion detected
2. **Press Arm Button**: GP13 button starts 30-second countdown
3. **Exit Premises**: Leave during countdown period
4. **System Armed**: Monitors all sensors continuously

### Disarming Options

1. **Keypad Code**: Enter 5-digit security code (displayed on web interface)
2. **Arm Button**: Physical button press (when not in alarm state)
3. **Web Interface**: Monitor status remotely

### Alarm Triggers

- **Door/Window Open**: When system is armed
- **Motion Detection**: When system is armed and entry points secure
- **Multiple Failed Codes**: After 3 incorrect attempts

## üåê Web Interface

Access the system via: `http://[PICO_IP_ADDRESS]:80`

### Dashboard Features
- Real-time sensor status with color-coded alerts
- Security code display with countdown timer
- Arming countdown visualization  
- Keypad entry status
- System information and statistics
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Security Settings
```python
ARMING_DELAY = 30           # 30-second exit delay
CODE_VALIDITY_TIME = 300    # 5-minute code validity
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3            # Maximum failed code attempts
TIMEZONE_OFFSET = 3         # Timezone adjustment
```

### Sensor Settings
```python
DOOR_SENSOR_PIN = 2
WINDOW_SENSOR_PIN = 3  
PIR_SENSOR_PIN = 4
BUZZER_PIN = 5
ARM_BUTTON_PIN = 13
```

   - Verify SDA/SCL connections
   - Ensure proper power supply

2. **Sensors Not Triggering**:
   - Verify GPIO pin assignments
   - Check pull-up/pull-down resistors
   - Test sensor functionality individually

3. **WiFi Connection Failed**:
   - Verify SSID and password
   - Check network availability
   - Monitor connection status on LCD

4. **Web Interface Unavailable**:
   - Confirm IP address display
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify port 80 availability
